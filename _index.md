I've been trying to learn Golang. Golang is such a charm to work with. The tooling feels like, it's been developed with
all the learnings and shortcomings of previous languages.

For example, There are **no unused variables**. Although it's annoying to see error thrown when compiling for unused
variables at first. It quickly becomes obvious. Similarly `go fmt`  tool is used to format go code. Making sure that the code is formatted as expected and there aren't a million different guidelines (which people barely follow). I personally think this method is better

Everything is made to just work out of the box. No riff raff. `go mod vendor` and just compiling works flawlessly.
Looking at python and js. This is plain incredible to work with.
